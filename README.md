# Stackelberg_Advertising_Game


Program developed for calculation of a Stackelberg Equilibrium in a Stochastic Dynamic Game of Advertising in order to get market share.


### Description:
This program provides a computational algorithm to approximate Stackelberg equilibria for a stochastic finite version of a game of advertising to get market share among two players a leader and a follower. In particular the random disturbances are assumed with Binomial distributions for each player.
In the first case, in order to simplify the calculations, the action sets for both firms are equal.

The Stackelberg equilibria are calculated with a procedure that involves rutines of otimization for both players and the empirical distribution as an estimator of the Binomial distribution.
Specifically, the program provides equilibrium strategies in the full-information game, as well as equilibrium strategies for some simulated empirical games, both in the set of pure strategies.

Among the variables that must be specified for the operation of the program are the number of states, number of trajectories, number of estimations, number of stages, the parameters of the Binomial distribution, the discount factor, etc.
